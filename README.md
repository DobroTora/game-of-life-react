in react all variables should be stored as a state or props. 
state variable belongs to whichever component has created this variable and should be in charge of that variable. 
state belongs to particular component. Wherever you want to pass this variable around it becomes a PROP!
All our variables are going to be stored in the Main component and we can pass them to other components as props.
